They're not just buzzwords to you - they're what you live by to keep our software top-notch.You're a bit of a wizard when it comes to making our CI/CD pipelines as sleek and efficient as a high-speed train.What Makes You an Awesome Fit:You've got a Bachelor’s in Computer Science or something similar, or you've been in the industry long enough to teach the class.You've been in the infrastructure ops game for at least 3 years.CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins? You've got them in your toolkit.Cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud? You navigate them like your hometown.If scripting languages were real languages, you'd be a polyglot (we’re talking shell scripting, Python, etc.).Kubernetes and container management are your playground (Docker, Helm, you name it).Bonus Points If You:Speak 'Infrastructure as Code' fluently (Terraform is your friend).Command-line tools? You’re a keyboard warrior (kubectl, Git, GitHub, gcloud – bring it on).Databases are your secret love affair (MySQL, PostgreSQL – the more, the merrier).Linux is your second home.You know your way around distributed storage and data systems (like Kafka).

Sales, Marketing and Global Services (SMGS)

AWS Sales, Marketing, and Global Services (SMGS) is responsible for driving revenue, adoption, and growth from the largest and fastest growing small- and mid-market accounts to enterprise-level customers including public sector. The AWS Global Support team interacts with leading companies and believes that world-class support is critical to customer success. AWS Support also partners with a global list of customers that are building mission-critical applications on top of AWS services.

Would you like to join one of the fastest-growing organizations within Amazon Web Services (AWS) and help customers of all industries and sizes gain the best value and service from AWS? AWS Enterprise Support, Technical Account Managers (TAM) support our customers’ creative and transformative spirit of innovation across all technologies, including Compute, Storage, Database, Big Data, Application-level Services, Networking, Serverless, Deployment, Security and more. This is not a sales role, but rather an opportunity to be the principal technical advisor and ‘voice of the customer’ to organizations ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500 enterprises.

Key job responsibilities

The TAM role is not directly hands on keyboard within the customer’s environment for troubleshooting customer support issues, rather you will work with appropriate engineers and service teams to see issues through to resolution. More importantly you will work proactively to help craft and execute strategies to drive our customers' adoption and use of AWS services, including EC2, S3, DynamoDB & RDS databases, Lambda, CloudFront CDN, IoT, and many more.

Your technical acumen and customer-facing skills will enable you to effectively represent AWS within a customer’s environment, and drive discussions with senior leadership regarding incidents, trade-offs, support and risk management.

A day in the life

You will provide advocacy and strategic technical guidance to help plan and build solutions using best practices, and proactively keep your customers’ AWS environments operationally healthy. The close relationships developed with your customers will allow you to understand their business/operational needs and technical challenges, and help them achieve the greatest value from AWS. This position will require the ability to travel 10% or more as needed.

The TAM is the centerpiece of value to our Enterprise Support customers. If you wish to be at the forefront of innovation, come join us!

A problem isn’t truly solved until it’s solved for all. That’s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you’ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You’ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company.

Our goal is to build a Google that looks like the world around us — and we want Googlers to stay and grow when they join us. As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company.

As a Technical Program Manager on the End-to-End Systems team in the Google Cloud Supply Chain and Operations Organization, you will be responsible for the development and maintenance of software tools that enable server capacity delivery in Google Data Centers.
